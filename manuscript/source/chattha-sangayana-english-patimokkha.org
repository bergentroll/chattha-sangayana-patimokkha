Introduction Recitation

Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me.

Today is Uposatha the 15th. [the 14th]

If the Sangha is ready the Sangha should do Uposatha, should recite the Patimokkha. What about the preliminary duties of the Sangha?

Venerables, do announce [your] complete purity, I shell recite the Patimokkha.

Let all of us present carefully listen [and] pay attention to it.

For whom there may be an offense he should reveal it; in the absence of an offense, one is to be silent.

Now, by being silent I shell know the Venerables are “completely pure”.

Now, just as one who has been individually questioned has an answer,  likewise in such an assembly
[when it*] has been repeatedly proclaimed up to the third time.

Should any bhikkhu, when it is being repeatedly proclaimed up to the third time, not reveal an existing offense that he remembers, there is false speech in full awareness for him.

Now, Venerables, false speech in full awareness has been said by the Blessed One to be an obstructive thing.

Therefore, an existing offense is to be revealed by the bhikkhu who has offended, remembers and seek purification.

When revealed, it is a comfort to him.

Recited, venerables, is the introduction.


Therein I ask the venerables,
so, are you completely pure?
For the second time too, I ask:
so, are you completely pure?
For the third time too, I ask
so, are you completely pure?

Completely pure the venerables are, therefore silent.
Thus I bear this in mind .

Nidāna has ended . [The introduction has ended.]

Pārājika Recitation
Therein, the four pārājika1 matters
come up for recitation.
The Training Rule about Sexual Intercourse
Should any bhikkhu who has undertaken the bhikkhus' training and livelihood—
without having given up the training,
without having declared his weakness
—engage in sexual intercourse,
even to the extent of with a female animal,
he is defeated, not in communion.
The Training Rule about Taking what is not Given
Should any bhikkhu
take, with a thieving mind, what is not given from the village or from the forest;
as in the taking of what is not given of such nature that kings, having arrested the robber,
would torture, imprison
or banish [him,
saying,] “You're a robber, you're a fool,
you're gone astray, you're a thief,”
the bhikkhu taking what is not given
of that nature,
he too is defeated, not in communion.
The Training Rule about a Human Being
Should any bhikkhu
intentionally deprive
a human being of life,
or seek a [life-]taking weapon for him, or praise the virtue of death,
or incite [him] to die,
[saying,] “Hey, man!
What use to you is this wretched, difficult life?
Death is better for you than life,”
with such a thought in mind, such an intention in mind, should he in various ways
praise the virtue of death
or incite [him] to die,
he too is defeated, not in communion.
The Training Rule about Superhuman State
Should any bhikkhu,
without realising
a superhuman state,
a noble knowledge and vision capable [of purification],
declare referring to oneself,
“Thus I know, thus I see,”
then, on a later occasion,
whether being cross-examined
or not being cross-examined,
should the offender seeking purification
say thus,
“Not knowing thus, friend, I said I know.
Not seeing, [I said] I see.
I vainly blathered falsehood,”
except in overestimation,
he too is defeated, not in communion.


Recited, venerables,
are the four pārājika matters.
A bhikkhu having committed
whichever of these
does not get
communion with the bhikkhus.
Just as before,
so is [he] afterwards:
he is defeated, not in communion.
Therein, I ask the venerables, “Now then, are you pure in this?” For the second time, I ask, “Now then, are you pure in this?” For the third time, I ask, “Now then, are you pure in this?” The venerables are pure in this, therefore are silent; thus do I bear that in mind.
Pārājika has ended.

* Sanghadisesa

Saṅghādisesa Recitation Now, venerables,
these thirteen saṅghādisesa2 matters
come up for recitation.
The Training Rule about Semen Emission
Intentional emission of semen,
except during a dream,
is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Bodily Contact
Should any bhikkhu,
fallen [into lust], with a perverted mind,
engage in bodily contact
with a woman
–holding the hand,
or holding a lock of hair,
or touching
whichever part–
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Gross Words
Should any bhikkhu,
fallen [into lust], with a perverted mind,
speak to a woman
with gross words referring to sex,
just as a young man [would] to a young woman,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Sexual Service for Oneself
Should any bhikkhu,
fallen [into lust], with a perverted mind,
speak in a woman's presence
of the virtue of ministering to
his own sensuality,
with reference to sex, [saying,]
“This, sister, is the highest of ministrations:
[that of] a woman who should minister to
one such as me, who is virtuous,
of good conduct, leading a holy life,
with that thing,”
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Going Back & Forth
Should any bhikkhu
engage in going back and forth [conveying] to a woman a man's intentions, or
to a man a woman's intentions
to be a wife or a mistress
even to the extent of being a temporary one,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Building a Hut
A bhikkhu having a hut—that is without a sponsor [and] intended for oneself—
built through self-begging,
is to have one within a limit built.
Therein, this is the limit:
in length, twenty spans,
going by the sugata-span; across, seven inside.
Bhikkhus are to be brought
to point out a site.
A site that is not dangerous
[and] has [space for] going around
is to be pointed out by those bhikkhus.
If a bhikkhu should have a hut built through self-begging at a site that is dangerous and without [space for] going around,
or should not bring bhikkhus
to point out a site.
or should exceed the limit,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Building a Dwelling
A bhikkhu having
a sizeable dwelling built,
with a sponsor, [and] intended for oneself,
is to bring bhikkhus to point out a site.
A site that is not dangerous [and] has [space for] going around is to be pointed out by those bhikkhus.
If a bhikkhu should have a sizeable dwelling built
at a site that is dangerous and without [space for] going around,
or should not bring bhikkhus to point out a site,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about One who is Offended, Angered
Should any bhikkhu,
offended, angered, displeased,
accuse a bhikkhu
of a baseless pārājika matter,
[thinking], “Perhaps I could make him fall
from this holy life,”
then, on a later occasion, whether being cross-examined or not being cross-examined,
[if] that case is baseless,
and the bhikkhu admits the fault,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about that which is Connected with Another
Should any bhikkhu,
offended, angered, displeased,
accuse a bhikkhu of a pārājika matters
by using as a mere ploy some point
of a case connected with another matter,
[thinking, ]“Perhaps I could make him fall
from this holy life,”
then, on a later occasion, whether being cross-examined or not being cross-examined
[if] that case is
connected with another matter,
a mere ploy has been used
and the bhikkhu admits the fault,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Saṅgha Breakup
Should any bhikkhu
strive for the breakup
of a united saṅgha,
or persist in taking up
and upholding the course
leading to the breakup,
that bhikkhu is to be told thus
by the bhikkhus,
“Do not, venerable, strive for
the breakup of a united saṅgha,
or persist in taking up
and upholding the course
leading to the breakup.
Let the venerable be harmonious with the saṅgha.
For a united saṅgha dwells comfortably,
rejoicing, not disputing,
having one [common] recitation.”
Should that bhikkhu,
being told thus by the bhikkhus,
uphold it just as before,
that bhikkhu is to be repeatedly spoken to by the bhikkhus up to the third time to give that up.
If he, being repeatedly spoken to up to the third time, were to give that up,
then that is good.
If he were not to give up,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about Breakup Follower
There are one, two or three bhikkhus
of that very bhikkhu,
who are [his] followers and separatists.
Should they say thus,
“Do not, venerables,
tell that bhikkhu anything.
That bhikkhu is a speaker of Dhamma.
That bhikkhu is also a speaker of Vinaya. And that bhikkhu speaks in accordance with our desire and preference. He knows and speaks for us.
And that is agreeable to us.”
Those bhikkhus should be told thus by the bhikkhus,
“Do not, venerables, say thus.
That bhikkhu is not a speaker of Dhamma. That bhikkhu is also not a speaker of Vinaya.
And do not let a breakup of the saṅgha be pleasing to the venerables.
Let [the mind] of the venerables
be harmonious with the saṅgha.
For a united saṅgha dwells comfortably, rejoicing, not disputing, having one [common] recitation.”
Should those bhikkhus, being told thus by the bhikkhus, uphold it just as before,
those bhikkhus is to be repeatedly spoken to by the bhikkhus up to the third time to give that up.
If they, being repeatedly spoken to up to the third time, were to give that up,
then that is good.
If they were not to give up,
there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about One who is Hard to be Told
A [certain] bhikkhu, despite being one, is by nature hard to be told in respect of the training rules included in the recitation;
being told according to regulations by the bhikkhus, [he] makes himself incapable of being told.
“Do not, venerables,
tell me anything
good or bad.
I too shall not
tell the venerables anything
good or bad.
Refrain, venerables,
from telling me3.”
That bhikkhu is to be told thus by the bhikkhus,
“Do not, venerable, make yourself incapable of being told.
Rather, venerable, make yourself
capable of being told.
Let the venerable tell the bhikkhus according to regulations.
The bhikkhus too shall tell the venerable according to regulations.
For in this way
has the Blessed One's assembly grown,
that is,
by telling one another,
by uplifting one another.
Should that bhikkhu, being told thus by the bhikkhus,
uphold it just as before,
that bhikkhu is to be repeatedly spoken to by the bhikkhus up to the third time to give that up.
If he, being repeatedly spoken to up to the third time, were to give that up, then that is good.
If he were not to give up, there is a saṅghādisesa.
The Training Rule about the Family Corrupter
A [certain] bhikkhu, despite being one,
lives depending on a certain village or small town, being a corrupter of families and one of evil ways,
His evil ways are seen and heard of;
families corrupted by him are also seen and heard of.
That bhikkhu is to be told thus by the bhikkhus,
“The venerable sir is a corrupter of families and one of evil ways.
The venerable's evil ways
are seen and heard of;
families corrupted by the venerable
are also seen and heard of.
Go away, venerable,
from this residence.
Enough of your stay here.”
Should that bhikkhu,
being told thus by the bhikkhus,
say to those bhikkhus thus,
“The bhikkhus are going by desire,
the bhikkhus are going by anger,
the bhikkhus are going by delusion,
the bhikkhus are going by fear.
Because of such an offence,
they banish some,
they don't banish some,”
that bhikkhu is to be told thus by the bhikkhus,
Do not, venerable, say thus.
The bhikkhus are not going by desire,
the bhikkhus are not going by anger,
the bhikkhus are not going by delusion,
the bhikkhus are not going by fear.
“The venerable
is a corrupter of families and one of evil ways.
The venerable's evil ways
are seen and heard of;
families corrupted by the venerable
are also seen and heard of.
Go away, venerable, from this residence.
Enough of your stay here.”
Should that bhikkhu, being told thus by the bhikkhus,
uphold it just as before,
that bhikkhu is to be repeatedly spoken to by the bhikkhus up to the third time to give that up.
If he, being repeatedly spoken to up to the third time, were to give that up, then that is good.
If he were not to give up, there is a saṅghādisesa.


Recited, venerables,
are the thirteen saṅghādisesa matters:
nine refer to offences [committed] at once,
four only after the third [admonishment].
A bhikkhu having committed whichever of these
is to live on probation against his will for as many days he knowingly conceals [the matter].
A further six nights [of penance] for the sake of the bhikkhus' respect is to be undertaken by the bhikkhu who has lived on probation.
The bhikkhu who has completed the mānatta is to be reinstated where there is a bhikkhu-saṅgha comprising a group of 20.
If a bhikkhu-saṅgha comprising a group of even one less than 20
should [proceed to] reinstate that bhikkhu,
that bhikkhu is not reinstated,
and those bhikkhus are censurable.
This is proper here.
Therein, I ask the venerables, "Now then, are you pure in this?" For the second time, I ask, "Now then, are you pure in this?" For the third time, I ask, "Now then, are you pure in this?" The venerables are pure in this, therefore are silent; thus do I bear that in mind.
The Saṅghādisesa has ended.

Now, venerables,
the two indefinite matters
come up for recitation.
First Aniyata Training Rule
Should any bhikkhu
sit5
together with a woman
— one man with one woman privately —
in a hidden seat
sufficiently convenient [for sexual intercourse];
[then] should a female lay follower of credible speech, having seen him,
speak according to any
of the three matters—
pārājika, saṅghādisesa or pācittiya; the bhikkhu, acknowledging sitting [thus],
is to be dealt with
according to any of the three matters: pārājika, saṅghādisesa or pācittiya.
Or, that bhikkhu is to be dealt with according to what the female lay follower of credible speech should say.
This matter is indefinite.

Second Aniyata Training Rule
However, [if]
the seat is not hidden,
not sufficiently convenient [for sexual intercourse],
yet sufficiently [so]
to speak
to a woman with lewd words,
[then] should any bhikkhu
sit
together with a woman
—one man with one woman privately—
in such a seat
[then] should a female lay follower of credible speech, having seen him,
speak according to any of the two matters— saṅghādisesa or pācittiya;
the bhikkhu, acknowledging sitting [thus], is to be dealt with according to any of the two matters— saṅghādisesa or pācittiya.
Or, that bhikkhu is to be dealt with according to what the female lay follower of credible speech should say.
This matter too is indefinite.


Recited, venerables,
are the two aniyata matters.
Therein, I ask the venerables, "Now then, are you pure in this?" For the second time, I ask, "Now then, are you pure in this?" For the third time, I ask, "Now then, are you pure in this?" The venerables are pure in this, therefore are silent; thus do I bear that in mind.
The Aniyata has ended.

with the robe.”
Therein, if that bhikkhu,
not being previously invited, should approach [him/her] and get into a special arrangement in regard to the robe,

If that messenger
should approach that bhikkhu and say thus:
“Bhante, this robe-buying [fund] intended for the venerable has been brought.
Let the venerable accept the robe-buying [fund].”
That messenger
should be told thus by that bhikkhu,
“We, friend, do not
accept a robe-buying [fund].
However, at the [proper] time, we do accept
a robe that is allowable.”
If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu,
“Has the venerable any steward?”8
Bhikkhus, a steward — either a monastery keeper or a lay follower — is to be indicated by the bhikkhu who need's a robe,
[saying,] “That, friend,
is the bhikkhus' steward.”
If that messenger should inform that steward,
then approach that bhikkhu
and say thus

Should he requesting [or] reminding [the steward] two or three times
bring about that robe,
then that is good.
If he should not bring [it] about,
he is to stand in silence for the purpose
four times, five times,
six times at most.

May that which is your own not be lost.”

The Sekhiyas have ended.

a “covering with grass” decision [may be given].
